        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I’m really into gaming, servers, and anything tech-related. I like being involved in how things work behind the scenes, whether that’s managing systems, helping a community grow, or learning how to build things myself. I don’t just play games, I enjoy working on the structure around them too.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m currently learning to code and get better at development, and I’m always trying to improve my skills as I go. I like figuring things out, fixing problems, and making things better than they were before. I take what I work on seriously, but I keep things chill and don’t overcomplicate stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, I’m motivated, always learning, and focused on growth. If I’m involved in something, I actually care about it and put in the effort to make it work.
